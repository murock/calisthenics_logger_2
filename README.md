# calisthenics_logger_2

Remake of calisthenics logger using Flutter framework

This project requires a firebase backend to run I have removed the api key secrets from the sourcecode so a new firebase project would need to be set up in order to run build and run this application. 
I can provide the google services files on request if I am interviewing for a role, and you are wanting to look at my work.

Useful terminal commands:

Rebuild injection container: flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
